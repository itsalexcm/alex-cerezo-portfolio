            `I was born and raised in a small town near Alicante, Spain. From an early age, I was drawn to technology. There was something magical about solving problems by pressing buttons, about the logic hidden within complexity. That fascination hit a peak in 2007 when I watched Steve Jobs unveil the first iPhone. Suddenly, I saw <span class="bold">a whole world of possibilities</span>.
            <br /><br />
            After studying Computer Engineering at university, I moved to Barcelona looking for broader experiences and new challenges. I started my professional journey in advertising agencies, but it was in product design where I found my real calling.
            <br /><br />
            Today, I split my time between Alicante and Barcelona, <span class="bold">building thoughtful digital products</span> that aim to simplify life without oversimplifying people.`
